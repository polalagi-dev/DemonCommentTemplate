# Daily, Weekly & Demon Comment Templates
**This mods adds a comment template button to the comment menu for daily, weekly and demon levels.**

A comment template looks like this: `AttemptCount Attempt(s), Demon #DemonCount`

- `AttemptCount` - Replaced with the current attempt count on the level
- `DemonCount` - Current amount of beaten demons
- `WeeklyID` - Current weekly #
- `DailyID` - Current daily #
- `CoinCount` - Amount of completed coins

Each one of the comment templates (demon, weekly, daily) can be changed in the mod's settings.

*The new UI is inspired by prevter's Comment Emojis Reloaded mod.*
