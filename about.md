# Daily, Weekly & Demon Comment Templates
**This mods adds a comment template button to the comment menu for daily, weekly and demon levels.**

A comment template looks like this: `AttemptCount Attempt(s), Demon #DemonCount`

- `AttemptCount` - Replaced with the current attempt count on the level
- `DemonCount` - Current amount of beaten demons
- `WeeklyID` - Current weekly #
- `DailyID` - Current daily #

Each one of the comment templates (demon, weekly, daily) can be changed in the mod's settings.

1. Go into the settings of this mod
2. Press the save folder icon
3. Once the folder opened, close GD
4. Edit `settings.json` in any text editor
